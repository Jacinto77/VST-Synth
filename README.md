Synthesizer VST Plugin

Created using the Juce C++ Framework

Purpose:
Personal project to explore and learn about audio synthesis programming using C++ and the Juce 
framework.

Goal:
Develop a fully featured VST Synthesizer plugin that can recreate iconic synthesizer tones 
from the 80's and 90's.

Desired Features:
- Implement LFO, VFO, and VCOs to produce a variety of waveforms for audio synthesis. 
- Design an intuitive GUI for altering the settings of the synth in a DAW
- Allow MIDI input to control the synthesizer, including the pitch of notes, pitch wheel and 
mod wheel integration, and potentially generic MIDI controller messages to alter the settings 
of the synth from an outboard MIDI controller
- Built-in sequencer 
- Built-in arpeggiator
